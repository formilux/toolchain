2008/05/11 : version 0.5.0
	* support for a default compiler
	* upgraded to gcc-4.1.2 for 4.1 branch
	* major makefile cleanup
	* makefile provides help by default

2008/05/10 : version 0.4.3
	* added --with-local-prefix to build g++
	* removed --with-gxx-include-dir
	* added --enable-symvers=gnu --enable-c99 --enable-long-long
	* updated uclibc to 0.9.28.3.
	* g++ now builds binaries (at least in version 3.4)

2006/07/17 : version 0.4.2
	* removed --with-headers and --with-libs in gcc to prevent it from
          copying libraries and headers at wrong places

2006/07/16 : version 0.4.1
	* fixed lots of problems with gcc >= 3 silently using binaries outside
	  the sysroot.
	* fixed sysroot installation with gcc >= 3 : now gcc does not install
	  anything in the sysroot, not even the libstdc++. Those must be
	  brought by external packages if needed.
	* added an "install" target which does some cleanup

2006/07/15 : version 0.4.0
	* added gcc-3.3, gcc-3.4 and gcc-4.1
	* binutils are now built with --with-sysroot (needed by gcc-4.1)

	* upgraded dietlibc to 0.30

2005/08/21 : version 0.3.1
	* moved libstdc++ to the rootdir instead of tooldir
	* moved libiberty to tooldir instead of rootdir
	* added the 'remove-unneeded' make target to clean useless files

2005/08/20 : version 0.3.0
	* gcc now provides working g++ and libstdc++
	* binutils: updated to 2.16.1
	* kernel-headers: updated to 2.4.31-wt1
	* kernel-headers are now arch-dependent
	* HOST arch/os changed to include 'x' in the middle of the name
	  in order to always differentiate between host and target.

2005/08/20 : version 0.2.2
	* Makefile: we now create sys-include everywhere there's an "include"
	  directory. This missing directory was the cause for gcc not to use
	  system includes such as "limits.h".
	* CHANGELOG: created
