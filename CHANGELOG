2005/08/21 : version 0.3.1
	* moved libstdc++ to the rootdir instead of tooldir
	* moved libiberty to tooldir instead of rootdir
	* added the 'remove-unneeded' make target to clean useless files

2005/08/20 : version 0.3.0
	* gcc now provides working g++ and libstdc++
	* binutils: updated to 2.16.1
	* kernel-headers: updated to 2.4.31-wt1
	* kernel-headers are now arch-dependent
	* HOST arch/os changed to include 'x' in the middle of the name
	  in order to always differentiate between host and target.

2005/08/20 : version 0.2.2
	* Makefile: we now create sys-include everywhere there's an "include"
	  directory. This missing directory was the cause for gcc not to use
	  system includes such as "limits.h".
	* CHANGELOG: created
