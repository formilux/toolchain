In the context where the toolchain would be deployed in order to be called
by distccd, at minima, we need to have the following directories on a target
machine :

$PREF/$PREF/bin
$PREF/bin
$PREF/lib/gcc/$PREF/$VER  [ dir only ]
$PREF/libexec

It can be achieved by removing all this :

$PREF/$PREF/[d-z]*
$PREF/share
$PREF/build.log*
$PREF/include
$PREF/lib/gcc/$PREF/$VER/*
$PREF/lib/*.a

The following tar command line is able to archive an existing toolchain to
save only the required files :

   tar --exclude="*-gcc*/*-gcc*/[d-z]*" --exclude="*-gcc*/share" --exclude="*-gcc*/build.log*" --exclude="*-gcc*/lib/gcc/*-gcc*/*/*" --exclude="*-gcc*/lib/*.a" -cf - $PREF | gzip -9 > $PREF-mini.tgz
